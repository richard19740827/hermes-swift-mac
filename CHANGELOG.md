## [v1.6.2] — 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- **Tab-bar / title-bar strip flashes white in multi-tab sessions, and stays stuck after closing the offending tab — bug #70** — v1.6.1's theme bridge sampled the page background by walking `document.elementsFromPoint(x, y)` at three fixed viewport coordinates. Any opaque modal, lightbox, settings panel, file-tree overlay, or image preview that covered any of the three sample points and stayed visible past the 2.5 s stability gate would make the bridge fire the *overlay's* colour. With multi-tab, that one tab's overlay-derived colour was then propagated to every other window's chrome, producing the symptom Cygnus filed in #70 (white tab strip persisting until the user could refresh). The pixel-sampling architecture is fundamentally fragile against legitimate page overlays. Fix: prefer the WebUI's own `<meta name="theme-color" id="hermes-theme-color">` tag (introduced in hermes-webui v0.51.x+) as the single source of truth — it's page-controlled, overlay-resistant, and updated by `boot.js` whenever the user toggles theme or skin. The bridge falls back to the original pixel-sampling path when the meta tag is absent (older WebUI servers, raw error pages), so behavior is unchanged for self-hosters who haven't updated yet. Also adds a `MutationObserver` on the meta tag's `content` attribute so toggles propagate without waiting for the 2 s poll tick. Closes #70.

## [v1.6.1] — 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **AppKit chrome (tab bar, title bar, traffic lights, status bars) now follows the web UI theme dynamically** — v1.6.0's multi-window/tabs feature exposed an appearance mismatch in light mode: the active tab rendered as a bright white strip against the always-dark Hermes web content. Single-window mode hid this since `.fullSizeContentView` + `titlebarAppearsTransparent` left no opaque AppKit chrome to clash with. Fix: a theme-bridge `WKUserScript` samples the page's effective background colour at three viewport pixels (via `document.elementsFromPoint`) and reports it to Swift via `webkit.messageHandlers.hermesTheme`. `AppDelegate.updateAppearance` propagates the matching `NSAppearance` (.aqua / .darkAqua) and the exact RGB to every browser, Preferences, Error, and Splash window — keeping the tab-bar strip, title bar, traffic lights, and SSH footer in lock-step with whatever theme the web UI currently shows. Three layers of defense against flicker: (1) match-suppression — samples that match the chrome's current colour are dropped silently, (2) 2500 ms stability gate — non-matching samples must hold steady for 2.5 s before firing, so React mount-time dark flashes never propagate, (3) persisted theme cache (UserDefaults, 7-day TTL) — `loadCachedTheme()` runs before `startTunnel` so the splash and first browser window open with the last-seen theme. Pre-paint `underPageBackgroundColor` and the `documentStart` body/html background script both read the cached colour, so Cmd+R and new-tab paint the correct theme from the very first frame.
- **Tab title shows the active conversation name** — `webView.title` is mirrored into `window.title` via KVO, with a regex-strip of trailing `" — Hermes"` / `" — Hermes Agent"` / pipe-or-hyphen-or-middle-dot separators so the brand suffix doesn't repeat noise on a Mac tab. Truncated to 40 chars with an ellipsis for longer titles. Falls back to `"Hermes Agent  ● host:port"` in direct mode (preserving the v1.5.0 health indicator) and `"Hermes Agent"` in SSH mode (the SSH status bar already surfaces host info).
- **SSH status bar at the bottom of the window now matches the page background colour exactly** — `NSVisualEffectView .titlebar` material was tinting the colour off via vibrancy, breaking the visual seam between the tab-bar strip and the SSH footer. Switched to plain `NSView` with explicit `.layer.backgroundColor = currentBackgroundColor.cgColor`, applied through a new `applyChromeBackgroundColor(_:)` method that `AppDelegate.updateAppearance` calls on every browser window. The 1-px separator re-resolves `NSColor.separatorColor.cgColor` in the window's effective appearance to keep its tone crisp.
- **Web-app titlebar auto-hides when the native AppKit tab bar is rendering** — once you have multiple tabs, the AppKit tab strip already shows each conversation's name (mirrored from `webView.title` via the KVO bridge). The web app's redundant `.app-titlebar` row (hard-coded "Hermes" text + sub badge) collapses via a `body.hermes-mac-tabbed` class injected at documentStart, then toggled by a new `updateAppTitlebarClass(tabbed:)` helper on every `updateWebViewLayout` pass and after `didFinish`. Closing tabs back down to one restores it. Bonus: switched the visibility check from raw `tabbedWindows.count > 1` to `NSWindowTabGroup.isTabBarVisible`, which also catches the explicit Window → Show Tab Bar case with a single window (a latent v1.6.0 bug where AppKit's bar would clip web content when manually requested).
- **Find bar covered by webView on resize / tab change (#68)** — v1.6.0's `updateWebViewLayout()` (called from `windowDidResize`, fullscreen transitions, and the `tabbedWindows` KVO observer) didn't consult `findBarVisible`, so any of those triggers grew the WKWebView frame back over the find bar — hiding the search field while the bar remained in the view hierarchy. Fixed by subtracting the 36 px find-bar height from `topY` when the find bar is open. The find bar's own frame is anchored to `contentLayoutRect.maxY - barHeight` so it follows the title-bar zone correctly across all transitions; only webView height needed the carve-out.

Engineering notes: most of this branch is the dynamic-theme-tracking architecture. Three layers of flicker defense (match-suppression, 2500 ms stability gate, persisted UserDefaults cache) work together so the only situation a user sees a colour change is when they actually toggled themes — never on Cmd+R, Cmd+T, or app launch. The 2500 ms gate makes user-initiated theme toggles feel slightly delayed (the chrome catches up 2.5 s after the page); future work could expose an explicit hermes-webui → Mac wrapper signal that bypasses the gate for known-deliberate changes.

## [v1.6.0] — 2026-05-02

### Added
- **Multi-window and native tabs (#42)** — open multiple independent Hermes sessions from the same app. `Cmd+N` opens a new window; `Cmd+T` does the same and lands as a tab when the user's "Prefer Tabs" system preference is set to Always (or In Full Screen). Each window owns its own `WKWebView` so server-side sessions stay independent — chat history, scroll position, in-flight streams, cookies, and localStorage are preserved per window. AppKit's native tabbing system fills in `Show Tab Bar`, `Show All Tabs`, `Move Tab to New Window`, and `Merge All Windows` automatically in the Window menu, plus the tab-bar plus button (wired through `newWindowForTab`). The frontmost browser window receives all menu actions (Find, Zoom, Reload); the global hotkey (default `Cmd+Shift+H`) and Dock-icon click both surface the most-recently-active window. Reconnect logic (SSH tunnel restore, network recovery via `NWPathMonitor`, manual retry) fans out across every open window — every WKWebView reloads in place, no session loss. Window frame autosave applies only to the first window of a session; subsequent windows cascade from the front-most window's frame so they're visibly stacked. Closes #42.

  Engineering notes: Opus pre-commit advisor caught four real correctness bugs before this shipped — (1) `onNavigationFailed` retain cycle leaking the BrowserWindowController + WKWebView for every nav failure, (2) `windowShouldClose` returning `false` unconditionally caused closed tabs to phantom in `browserWindows` because `windowWillClose` doesn't fire on `orderOut`, (3) `windowDidExitFullScreen` clobbered `windowWasFullScreen` even when other windows remained fullscreen, (4) `alphaValue=0` fade-in created a visible flash on tabs joining an existing tab group. All four fixed inline before push.

## [v1.5.4] — 2026-05-02

### Fixed
- **Download links now save instead of rendering raw content** — clicking a download link in the web UI loaded the raw response data into the WKWebView window instead of prompting for a save location. The `decidePolicyFor navigationResponse` handler now intercepts responses whose `Content-Disposition` header begins with `attachment` (case-insensitive) **or** whose MIME type WebKit can't render, and hands them off to `WKDownload`. The new `WKDownloadDelegate` extension presents an `NSSavePanel` pre-filled with the server's suggested filename, runs as a sheet on the main window, and surfaces failures via a sheet alert. Closes the gap where attachments from the chat UI (file exports, downloads from previous sessions, etc.) had no way to be saved. (#66, thanks @redsparklabs)

## [v1.5.3] — 2026-04-28
### Fixed
- **Window drag regression** — after the v1.5.0 `.fullSizeContentView` change, the main window could no longer be moved by dragging the title bar. `WKWebView` covers the full content area including the transparent native title bar strip and intercepts all mouse events; `-webkit-app-region: drag` in the web page's CSS has no effect on `NSWindow` dragging. Fixed by adding a thin transparent `TitleBarDragView` overlay positioned over the title bar zone (height 38 px, matching `.app-titlebar` in the web UI) that calls `window.performDrag(with:)` on `mouseDown`. The view is fully transparent and only captures hits within its own bounds. Traffic lights live in `NSThemeFrame` above `contentView` and are unaffected. (fixes #64)

## [v1.5.2] — 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **Title bar text re-centered** — v1.5.1 hid the `.app-titlebar-icon` with `display: none`,
  which collapsed its layout space and shifted the title text left. Changed to
  `visibility: hidden` so the icon is invisible but still occupies its flex slot, keeping
  the title centered as intended. Closes #61.

## [v1.5.1] — 2026-04-25

### Fixed
- **Title bar icon no longer overlaps traffic lights** — the web app's `.app-titlebar-icon`
  SVG logo is hidden when running inside the Mac wrapper via an injected `documentStart`
  stylesheet. With `.fullSizeContentView` (added in v1.5.0) the icon appeared right next
  to the close button. The rest of the web title bar is unaffected. Closes #59.

## [v1.5.0] — 2026-04-25

### Added
- **Configurable global hotkey** — the hardcoded Cmd+Shift+H shortcut is now user-configurable
  in Preferences. Click the new recorder field to arm it, press any combo with Cmd/Ctrl/Option,
  and the shortcut updates immediately. Press Delete while recording to clear (disable) the
  hotkey. The combo is persisted in UserDefaults and survives app restarts. Closes #41.

### Changed
- **Full-size content view** — web content now extends under the native macOS title bar using
  `.fullSizeContentView` + `titlebarAppearsTransparent`. The web app's custom `.app-titlebar`
  element sits in the title-bar region, eliminating the doubled native/web header. Traffic
  lights stay visible via a `--traffic-light-width` CSS custom property (default `80px`,
  refined to the exact measured value after first paint). The variable resets to `0px` in
  fullscreen and restores on exit. Closes #57.

### Fixed
- **Session state preserved on reconnect** — tunnel drops, network blips, and manual reconnects
  no longer destroy the WKWebView. The existing browser window is hidden (orderOut) and reused
  on reconnect via `reconnectInPlace()`, preserving localStorage, cookies, IndexedDB, and
  scroll position. The WKWebView is only replaced when the error window takes over on a failed
  reconnect. Closes #10.

## [v1.4.1] — 2026-04-23

### Added
- **Find submenu in Edit menu** — Edit → Find → Find… (Cmd+F), Find Next (Cmd+G),
  Find Previous (Cmd+Shift+G). Makes the find feature discoverable via the standard
  macOS menu convention instead of requiring users to know the shortcut.

## [v1.4.0] — 2026-04-23

### Fixed
- **White flash on startup eliminated (for real this time)** — the window is now started
  with `alphaValue = 0` and fades in (0.15s) on `didFinishNavigation` — the point at which
  WKWebView has actually painted its first frame. A `hasCompletedFirstPaint` flag ensures
  the animation only fires once; SPA route changes and Cmd+R reloads are unaffected.
  Additionally, the NSWindow frame background and the WKWebView pre-paint `documentStart`
  script are both set to `#1a1a1a` (dark) regardless of the system colour scheme, so any
  gap between window-visible and first paint is never white in any situation. Closes #52.

### Added
- **Find in page — Cmd+F** — pressing Cmd+F opens a native find bar (NSSearchField overlay
  with vibrancy) anchored below the title bar. `‹` / `›` buttons and Cmd+G / Cmd+Shift+G
  cycle through results via `window.find()` JS. Pressing Done or Escape closes the bar.
  Closes #37, closes #45.

### Changed
- **Connection error copy no longer hardcodes `~/hermes-webui-public`** — the error
  window now says "Run: bash start.sh (or: docker compose up -d)" instead of the path
  that only applied to one specific install layout. Closes #40.

## [v1.3.6] — 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **`build.sh` now embeds entitlements in local ad-hoc builds** — `codesign` in `build.sh`
  was signing without `--entitlements Entitlements.plist`, so locally-built `.app` bundles
  never had any embedded entitlements (including `com.apple.security.device.audio-input`).
  CI was correct (it already passed `--entitlements`). Local builds now embed the same
  entitlements as CI-signed DMGs, making mic and other entitlement-gated features testable
  without a full CI run. (reviewer follow-up from #50)
- **Stale comment in `LaunchBehaviorTests`** — the warm-up regression history comment still
  referenced `default(for:)` and omitted the v1.3.5 entitlement root cause. Updated to
  accurately describe the fix history through v1.3.5. (reviewer follow-up from #50)

## [v1.3.5] — 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Microphone actually works — root cause finally found** — the `Entitlements.plist` had
  `com.apple.security.device.microphone` which is not a valid hardened-runtime entitlement
  key and is silently ignored by the codesigner. The correct key is
  `com.apple.security.device.audio-input`. Every DMG since the beginning of the project was
  signed without the actual mic entitlement, making `getUserMedia()` fail at the OS level
  regardless of TCC status. Fixed in `Entitlements.plist`. CI applies the plist via
  `--entitlements Entitlements.plist` so the fix propagates automatically.
- **WKUIDelegate mic delegate no longer short-circuits on `.authorized`** — the previous
  implementation checked `AVCaptureDevice.authorizationStatus` and called
  `decisionHandler(.grant)` directly when `.authorized`, bypassing `requestAccess`. That
  bypass skips the XPC message to `tccd` that WebContent needs for its capture attribution
  to succeed. The delegate now always routes through `AVCaptureDevice.requestAccess` — when
  already `.authorized` it completes immediately with no UI, when `.notDetermined` it shows
  the OS prompt, when `.denied` it shows the recovery alert. (user-reported)
- **`warmUpCaptureSubsystem` now uses `requestAccess` instead of `AVCaptureDevice.default`** —
  `default(for: .audio)` only queries IOKit and does not contact `tccd`. `requestAccess`
  sends the XPC message that primes the attribution chain for WebContent.

### Added
- **Regression documentation tests** — `LaunchBehaviorTests.swift` with documented invariants
  for `warmUpCaptureSubsystem` and the window frame autosave pattern. Tests pass trivially
  but carry the full regression history so future refactors cannot delete these invariants
  silently. Test count: 20 → 22. (reviewer follow-up from #49)

## [v1.3.4] — 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Microphone actually works again** — `getUserMedia()` was failing with `NotAllowedError`
  even when TCC was `.authorized` (mic enabled in System Settings). Root cause: removing the
  launch-time `requestMicrophonePermission()` call in v1.3.2 also removed its undocumented
  side effect of initialising AVFoundation in the host process. The WebContent XPC process
  has no `audio-input` entitlement of its own and inherits TCC attribution via the host's
  active AVFoundation session. Without that session, capture fails at the platform layer
  regardless of the delegate returning `.grant`. Fixed: `warmUpCaptureSubsystem()` calls
  `AVCaptureDevice.default(for: .audio)` silently at launch — no UI, no prompt, no change
  in UX — purely to establish the attribution chain that WebContent inherits.
  (user-reported regression since v1.3.2)
- **Shared window autosave name constant** — `"HermesMainWindow"` appeared twice in
  `BrowserWindowController`: once as the `windowFrameAutosaveName` value and once embedded
  in the derived UserDefaults key `"NSWindow Frame HermesMainWindow"`. Extracted to
  `private static let windowAutosaveName`. The derived key is now interpolated from the
  constant, eliminating the drift risk. (reviewer follow-up from #48)

## [v1.3.3] — 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Microphone "access denied" error after v1.3.2 upgrade** — v1.3.2 correctly removed the
  aggressive launch-time mic prompt, but also inadvertently removed the recovery path for users
  whose TCC permission was already `.denied`. Those users got silent failure with no way back.
  Fixed: the `.denied` branch now calls `decisionHandler(.deny)` immediately (so WebKit doesn't
  wait) and then shows a single "Open System Settings" alert pointing to Privacy & Security →
  Microphone. Throttled to once per app session so it can't spam. (user-reported regression from v1.3.2)
- **Window size still resetting to default after v1.3.2** — the v1.3.2 fix called
  `setFrameAutosaveName` and `setFrameUsingName` on the raw `NSWindow` before `super.init`.
  `NSWindowController` has its own `windowFrameAutosaveName` property that both saves and
  restores the frame — when the controller initialises, its default empty value overwrote the
  window-level setting, so subsequent resizes were never persisted. Fixed: removed the window-level
  calls and set `self.windowFrameAutosaveName = "HermesMainWindow"` on the controller after
  `super.init`. AppKit now manages save and restore atomically. `center()` is guarded to
  first-launch only. (user-reported regression from v1.3.2)

## [v1.3.2] — 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Microphone permission prompt no longer appears on every launch** — removed the proactive
  `requestMicrophonePermission()` call from `applicationDidFinishLaunching`. That call fired
  on every launch and, once the user had denied mic access, showed an `NSAlert` on *every*
  subsequent launch regardless of whether the mic was needed. The `WKUIDelegate` method
  `requestMediaCapturePermissionFor` already handles mic grants correctly and lazily — the
  OS prompt only appears the first time the user actually clicks the mic button in the web UI.
  (user-reported)
- **Window size now persists across launches** — for programmatically created `NSWindow`
  instances, `setFrameAutosaveName` saves future frame changes but does not restore the
  previously saved frame on re-creation. Added `setFrameUsingName("HermesMainWindow")`
  immediately after the autosave call; `center()` now only runs on first launch (when no
  saved frame exists). Last used size and position are preserved across restarts. (user-reported)
- **Navigation failure double-fire guard** — both `didFailProvisionalNavigation` and the
  5xx `decidePolicyFor navigationResponse` handler can fire on the same failing load event
  during teardown. Added `didReportNavigationFailure` flag so the error window is only
  opened once per navigation attempt.

## [v1.3.1] — 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Shared zoom key constant** — `"webViewMagnification"` was defined as a private static
  in `AppDelegate` and duplicated as a bare string literal in `BrowserWindowController`.
  Made `AppDelegate.zoomKey` internal so `BrowserWindowController` references the single source
  of truth. (reviewer follow-up from #44)
- **NWPathMonitor reconnect scope documented** — added inline comment to `scheduleAutoReconnect`
  clarifying that it fires on network-link events only, not backend-health events.
- **`(NSApp.delegate as? AppDelegate)` cast comment** — acknowledged the intentional coupling
  and why a full protocol abstraction isn't warranted here.

## [v1.3.0] — 2026-04-20

### Added
- **Auto-reconnect on network restore (NWPathMonitor)** — when WiFi drops and comes back,
  or a VPN connects, the app automatically re-attempts connection without any manual click.
  Only fires when the app is already in an error or disconnected state; no action is taken
  if the backend is simply down with a healthy network. Uses `Network.framework`
  `NWPathMonitor`, no Accessibility permission required. (closes #38)
- **Zoom level persistence** — zoom level (Cmd++/Cmd+-/Cmd+0) is now saved to UserDefaults
  and restored after every page load, including reconnects. (part of closes #43)
- **Full-screen state persistence** — if the app was in full-screen when quit, it returns to
  full-screen on next launch. Uses `NSWindowDelegate` `windowDidEnterFullScreen`/
  `windowDidExitFullScreen` callbacks. (part of closes #43)
- **Dock icon badge when offline** — the Dock icon shows a "!" badge when the backend is
  unreachable (direct mode health check failure or SSH tunnel disconnects). Clears
  automatically when the connection is restored. Visible even when the window is hidden. (closes #39)
- **View → Open in Browser** — opens the configured Hermes URL in the system default browser.
  Useful for comparison or debugging without changing any settings.

## [v1.2.2] — 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Preferences window truncation** — widened window from 480 to 520px. "Save & Reconnect" button width increased (100 → 140px) so the label no longer clips. Notification checkbox width increased (290 → 330px) to fit the full label. All section headers, dividers, and input fields scaled accordingly. (fixes #34)

### Added
- **Window → Show Hermes (⌘⇧H)** — menu item in the Window menu that mirrors the global hotkey, making it discoverable. Teaches the shortcut to users who scan menus. (fixes #35)
- **Preferences: global shortcut label** — read-only "Global shortcut: ⌘⇧H — bring Hermes forward from any app" row in the APP section of Preferences. (fixes #35)
- **README: Keyboard shortcuts table** — new section listing all six keyboard shortcuts including the global ⌘⇧H. (fixes #35)

## [v1.2.1] — 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **RegisterEventHotKey OSStatus now checked** — if Cmd+Shift+H is already claimed by another app (Alfred, Raycast, etc.), a diagnostic `NSLog` fires instead of silently no-opping. Surfaced by the v1.2.0 independent review.
- **Redundant `notificationsEnabled` seed removed** — `seedDefaultsIfNeeded()` was setting `notificationsEnabled` alongside `UserDefaults.standard.register(defaults:)`, which already covers both fresh installs and upgrades. The seed in `register(defaults:)` is the authoritative one; the duplicate in `seedDefaultsIfNeeded` is removed.
- **Notifications checkbox init cleaned up** — `target` and `action` are now set in the `NSButton` initializer directly, removing the redundant two-line post-init reassignment.

## [v1.2.0] — 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- **Notification copy** — preferences toggle now reads "Show a notification when a response completes while the **app** is in the background" — replacing the old "tab" wording left over from browser context. The toggle is wired to a new UserDefaults key (`notificationsEnabled`, default on) so users can disable native notifications. (fixes #28)

### Added
- **Cmd+,** — opens Preferences (standard macOS keyboard shortcut). Already wired; documented here explicitly.
- **Cmd+R** — reloads the WebUI page via a new View → Reload menu item.
- **Cmd+W** — hides the window instead of quitting. App stays running in the Dock; clicking the Dock icon brings it back. `applicationShouldTerminateAfterLastWindowClosed` returns `false` and `applicationShouldHandleReopen` re-surfaces the window.
- **Window position memory** — `setFrameAutosaveName("HermesMainWindow")` restores last size and position on every launch.
- **Global hotkey Cmd+Shift+H** — brings Hermes forward from any app using Carbon `RegisterEventHotKey`. No Accessibility permission required; works on first launch. (closes #6)

## [v1.1.0] — 2026-04-19

### Added
- **Launch at login** — Preferences now includes a "Launch at login" checkbox (macOS 13+, SMAppService). Correctly handles `.requiresApproval` state and shows a System Settings nudge. Disabled with an inline note on macOS 12. (fixes #3)
- **View zoom — Cmd+/Cmd− keyboard shortcuts** — new View menu with Zoom In, Zoom Out, and Actual Size. Pinch-to-zoom was already enabled; this adds keyboard control. (fixes #24)
- **Connection status in window title** — direct-mode window title now shows the active backend host and a live indicator (● connected / ○ offline). A 30-second health poll detects when the backend goes away without a full page reload. (fixes #29)

### Fixed
- **Non-localhost URLs silently failing** — plain `http://` to Tailscale IPs, LAN addresses, and custom hostnames was blocked by App Transport Security in WKWebView. Added `NSAllowsArbitraryLoadsInWebContent` to Info.plist (both `build.sh` and CI workflow). URLSession (used for connection preflight) keeps default ATS restrictions. (fixes #25)
- **Dark mode white flash on startup** — WKWebView rendered white before the dark theme loaded. Set `underPageBackgroundColor` to `.windowBackgroundColor` (macOS 12+) and added a `documentStart` userScript to set the HTML background before first paint. (fixes #23)
- **Error screen didn't name the backend repo** — first-time users who hit "Cannot connect" had no way to find the backend. Added a clickable "github.com/nesquena/hermes-webui" link to the error screen in direct mode. (fixes #27)

## [v1.0.9] — 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- **SSH tunnel silently broken on servers where `localhost` resolves to IPv6 first** — the tunnel forwarded to `localhost:<port>` on the remote side, but many Linux systems map `localhost` to `::1` ahead of `127.0.0.1` in `/etc/hosts`. Combined with the common case of dev servers binding only to IPv4 `127.0.0.1`, ssh would connect to `[::1]:<port>` and get "connection reset" on every request — while the local port check happily reported "Tunnel connected". The forward now always targets `127.0.0.1`, matching what most dev servers bind to.
- **"Tunnel connected" shown even when the tunnel was end-to-end broken** — readiness check used to be a local TCP connect to the forwarded port, which ssh accepts immediately regardless of whether the far end is reachable. Replaced with an HTTP round-trip probe so the status reflects what the browser will actually experience.
- **Try Again button on the connection-error screen led to a permanent white window** — the HTML error page was loaded with a nil base URL, so `window.location.reload()` reloaded `about:blank`. Replaced the WebView error page with a small native error window whose Try Again button re-runs the full connection flow.

### Changed
- **Connection failures show a compact native window instead of a full-size WebView error page.** The main browser window only opens after the app has verified the server responds — an HTTP preflight runs in direct mode, and in SSH mode the tunnel's HTTP probe gates the browser. If either fails, a small native "Cannot connect" window appears with Try Again and Preferences… buttons.

## [v1.0.8] — 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- **Test Connection false "Unreachable"** — clicking Test Connection against a running server often showed "✗ Unreachable" even when the server was working. Two bugs: the probe used a `HEAD` request (many dev servers return 405/501 for HEAD even when GET works), and the success range was restricted to HTTP 200–399 (so a 404 or 500 falsely showed as unreachable). Now uses GET and treats any HTTP response as reachable — only an actual network failure shows ✗.
- **App icon rendered with a white chrome frame in the Dock** — the source PNG had a ~260 px opaque light-gray margin around the squircle, which showed up as a pale tile behind the icon on dark Dock backgrounds. Replaced with a properly cropped icon where the squircle fills the full canvas edge-to-edge and the area outside the rounded corners is genuinely transparent.

### Changed
- **Release notes now mirror the CHANGELOG.** The GitHub release body (and therefore Sparkle's "update available" dialog) now starts with a "What's changed" section auto-extracted from this file for the matching version tag, so users can see the actual list of fixes instead of generic download boilerplate. New releases without a CHANGELOG entry show a clear placeholder.

## [v1.0.7] — 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- **Auto-update "error launching the installer"** — clicking **Install Update** from the Sparkle dialog failed with "An error occurred while launching the installer" because the app was shipping Sparkle's sandboxed XPC services (`Downloader.xpc`, `Installer.xpc`) despite not being sandboxed itself. Per Sparkle's own docs, XPC services are only for sandboxed apps; shipping them in a non-sandboxed app causes launchd to reject the XPC launch. With the XPCs removed from the embedded framework, Sparkle falls back to its in-process installer path, which is the supported flow for non-sandboxed apps.

## [v1.0.6] — 2026-04-17

### Added
- macOS notifications (#8) — when a response finishes while the app window is in the background, a native macOS notification appears. Permission is requested on first trigger. Works via a debounced MutationObserver injected into the WebView.
- Test Connection button in Preferences (#4) — click to verify the target URL is reachable before saving. Shows "✓ Connected" or "✗ Unreachable" inline with a 5-second timeout. Works for both direct and SSH tunnel modes.

### Fixed
- White screen on failed connection (#12) — if the WebView cannot reach the server, a helpful error page now loads instead of a blank white screen. Shows the target URL, mode-specific guidance (direct: start command, SSH: tunnel check), and a Try Again button.

## [v1.0.4] — 2026-04-16

### Added
- Sparkle 2 auto-update support — app now checks `https://hermes-webui.github.io/hermes-swift-mac/appcast.xml` on launch and shows a native update dialog when a new version is available. A "Check for Updates…" menu item is available under the app menu at any time. (PR #21, closes #17)
- `Entitlements.plist` — hardened runtime entitlements for network access and microphone. Required for notarization. App remains unsandboxed so SSH tunnel (NSTask) continues to work. (PR #21)
- `appcast.xml` template in repo root — Sparkle update feed published at `https://hermes-webui.github.io/hermes-swift-mac/appcast.xml`. (PR #21)

### Fixed
- WKWebView navigation guard — external links (any http/https URL that is not localhost or the configured SSH host) now open in Safari instead of navigating inside the app. `file://` URLs are blocked entirely. (PR #21, closes #7)

### Changed
- CI release workflow now imports a Developer ID Application certificate, signs the app with hardened runtime, notarizes via `notarytool`, and staples the ticket to the DMG. Users on v1.0.4+ will no longer see the Gatekeeper "unidentified developer" warning on first launch. (PR #21)
- CI generates a Sparkle ed25519 signature for each DMG and embeds it in the release notes for appcast maintenance. (PR #21)

## [v1.0.3] — 2026-04-16

### Added
- Microphone permission prompt at app launch — macOS shows the system dialog on first run before the user touches the mic button. If previously denied, a native alert appears with an "Open System Settings" button linking directly to Privacy & Security → Microphone. (PR #18, fixes #16, by @redsparklabs)
- `requestMediaCapturePermissionFor` WKUIDelegate method — WKWebView now forwards microphone access requests through the macOS TCC authorization lifecycle before granting or denying `getUserMedia`. Without this, the browser `getUserMedia` call silently fails even when system permission is granted. (PR #18, fixes #16, by @redsparklabs)
- `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` added to Info.plist (both build.sh and CI workflow) — macOS requires this string to show the system microphone permission dialog. Previously present only in build.sh, now also in the CI workflow so downloaded DMGs work correctly. (PR #18, fixes #16)

### Fixed
- Web notification permission prompts suppressed — a WKUserScript overrides `Notification.requestPermission` to always resolve as "denied", preventing browser-style permission dialogs from appearing inside the native wrapper. UNUserNotificationCenter is the correct path for response alerts in a native app. (PR #18, fixes #14, by @redsparklabs)
- `webkitSpeechRecognition` suppressed via WKUserScript — forces hermes-webui to fall back to its MediaRecorder + `/api/transcribe` backend path, which works reliably. WebKit's built-in local speech model is slow and inconsistent. (PR #18, by @redsparklabs)

All notable changes to Hermes Agent for macOS are documented here.

## [v1.0.2] — 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- Buttons like "New conversation" had no effect when the WebView lost focus; the first click was consumed entirely by focus restoration and never reached JavaScript. Fixed by subclassing `WKWebView` as `HermesWebView` and overriding `acceptsFirstMouse` to return `true`, so a refocusing click also registers as content interaction. (PR #19, fixes #13, by @redsparklabs)
- Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+K, etc.) required an extra click after switching away and back. Fixed by implementing `NSWindowDelegate.windowDidBecomeKey` to restore WebView keyboard focus whenever the window becomes key. (PR #19, by @redsparklabs)

## [v1.0.1] — 2026-04-15

### Fixed
- `CFBundleShortVersionString` missing from `build.sh` — locally-built apps showed an empty version string in About dialog and Finder Get Info. Now set from the version argument. (PR #1)
- `SplashWindowController` container view did not resize with the window — missing `autoresizingMask = [.width, .height]`. Fixed. (PR #1)

### Changed
- README improvements: added install instructions, Gatekeeper workaround, SSH security section, architecture table, troubleshooting guide. (PR #1)

## [v1.0.0] — 2026-04-15
